### Example of work


#### Android Rolling Calculator

This is another project that I have completed somewhat recently. It as a rolling calculator (meaning each operation is executed and an answer is calculated by the next operator press). It has validation to ensure a number was entered before a operator is selected and to ensure warn of a divide by zero error.

This was the first Android application that I made that actually did anything. It 

#### C# Game

This is an example of the work that I have completed recently. It is and game in the style of Spy Hunter, where the user controls the car at the bottom of the screen with the arrow keys, while other cars cascade down from the top of the screen. If the player's car collides with any other vehicle you lose. The objective is to survive for thirty seconds in my game.

This project demonstrates my prowess at problem solving. Although I play video games quite often I have never attempted making one, even a very simple one. This being the first of any kind of game that I have created I encounterd quite a few problems along the way, such as how to move the character, how to create the background, how to create a timer, and detecting collisions. These were all things that I had not previously encountered and so figuring out how to acheive each was a problem solving opportunity. One of the largest problems I solved in this project was how to get the cars on the left side to go faster and the image be flipped. In the end I got a 100% on the project.#### PHP/Laravel "Social Media Feed"


<!--- This is a website I created using php and Laravel. It is a social media type websites that allows for the creation and viewing of image posts.
